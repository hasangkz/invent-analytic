# Nodejs API Development For Library

I use Node.js - Express.js - PostgreSQL - Typeorm and Typescript in my project. I tried to apply layered architecture as much as possible in my project. You can find the ddl file in .src/sql. This sql command will create the necessary tables in PostgreSQL for you. Thank you.
